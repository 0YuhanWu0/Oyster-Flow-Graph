# Oyster-Flow-Graph
  This package contains notebooks and data used to compute oyster flow-network   metrics across thresholds,and  relate metrics to environmental variables.
## Required Input Data
  All rasters must be co-registered (same resolution, extent, and CRS).

  Hydrology rasters (in `Oyster Flow Graph/`):
  - `FlowAcc_Flow51.tif`
  - `FlowDir_Fill31.tif`

  Stream rasters (generated by WhiteboxTools; may already exist):
  - `HS_slope_streams.tif`
  - `HS_slope_link.tif`
  - `HS_slope_order.tif`

  Basin polygons:
  - `oysterbasin0325.shp` (+ .shx/.dbf/.prj/.cpg)

  Environmental rasters (in `env data/`):
  - `NO30.tif`, `NO31.tif`, `NO32.tif`
  - `chlorophyll0.tif`, `chlorophyll1.tif`, `chlorophyll2.tif`
  - `salt0.tif`, `salt1.tif`, `salt2.tif`
  - `temp0.tif`, `temp1.tif`, `temp2.tif`
  - `u0.tif`, `u1.tif`, `u2.tif`
  - `v0.tif`, `v1.tif`, `v2.tif`
  - `w0.tif`, `w1.tif`, `w2.tif`

  ## How to Run (Colab)
  1. Upload the entire `oyster flow_2026/` folder to Google Drive.
  2. Open a notebook in Colab.
  3. Mount Drive, then set:
     - `PROJECT_DIR = "/content/drive/My Drive/oyster flow_2026"`
       (update if you use a different folder name)
  4. Ensure:
     - `Oyster Flow Graph/` and `env data/` are inside `PROJECT_DIR`.
  5. Run the notebook cells top to bottom.

  ## Outputs
  Notebooks save PDF plots and CSV summaries to `OFG_result` (as defined in each
  notebook).
  You can change `RESULT_DIR` in the config cell to redirect outputs.

  ## Notes
  - If a shapefile is used, all its sidecar files must be present.
  - If paths differ from the defaults, update the `PROJECT_DIR` and related
  paths in each notebook.
